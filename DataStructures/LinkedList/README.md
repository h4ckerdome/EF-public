## Welcome to the ~~HackerDome~~, _cough_ _cough_, I mean EngineerFactory&trade;. 

### Mission

So it seems the Senior Engineer has left for the week and stuck you with finishing up their jira ticket. Thankfully they left you with some structure for the Linked List you need to implement and some tests that are failing.

All you need to do is complete the following methods for the LinkedList struct and you are done for the day.

Finish the following methods in [LinkedList.go](LinkedList.go):
- `Find`
- `Delete`
- `Len`

They were even nice enough to leave some comments for you. 

Run your tests with the following command in from the 'LinkedList' folder:

- `go test -v`
